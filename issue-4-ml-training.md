# Implement continuous learning for intent classification

## Problem Description
Current intent classification uses static training data. Need continuous learning to improve accuracy over time.

## Proposed Features
- User feedback collection for intent corrections
- Automated retraining pipeline
- A/B testing for model improvements
- Performance metrics tracking

## Technical Requirements
- Model versioning system
- Training data management
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Rollback capabilities

## Files to Create/Modify
- `services/ai-service/src/services/ModelTrainingService.ts`
- `services/ai-service/src/services/FeedbackCollectionService.ts`
- Database migrations for training data storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feedback collection API endpoints
- [ ] Automated retraining pipeline
- [ ] Model performance tracking
- [ ] Safe model deployment process

## Priority
High
